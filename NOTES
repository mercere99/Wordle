Assuming wordcount N = 5000

There are 3^5 = 243 possible results.

NNNNN

ENNNN x 5
EENNN x 10
EEENN x 10
EEEEN x 5
EEEEE

HNNNN x 5
HHNNN x 10
HHHNN x 10
HHHHN x 5
HHHHH - trivial

EHNNN x 20
EHHNN x 30
EHHHN x 20
EHHHH x 5 - impossible

EEHNN x 30
EEHHN x 30
EEHHH x 10

EEEHN x 20
EEEHH x 10

EEEEH x 5



If we are going to track next options for each word we have two ways of doing this:
1 - Keep a list of which words are possible next.
    2 bytes per word x 5000 words - ~10k bytes (plus overhead for result groupings.)
    For all 5000 words, this is 50m bytes
    Slow for finding unions & intersections (though sorting helps)
2 - Keep an easy-to-modify bitmap of next words.
    5000 bits per grouping x 243 groupings = ~150k bytes
    For all 5000 words, this is 750m bytes
    FAST for finding unions and intersections.
